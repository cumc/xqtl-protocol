    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we have implemented two pipelines for RNA-seq data normalization along the lines of the GTEx V8 workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- A. Read counts -> TPM (within sample normalization) -> TPM level QC -> Quantile normalization (between sample normalization) -> inverse normal transformation\n",
    "- B. Read counts -> TMM (via edgeR, between sample normalization) -> inverse normal transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "The GTEx protocol, described [here](https://gtexportal.org/home/documentationPage#staticTextAnalysisMethods), suggests that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Genes were selected based on expression thresholds of >0.1 TPM in at least 20% of samples and ≥6 reads in at least 20% of samples.\n",
    "2. Expression values were normalized between samples using TMM as implemented in edgeR (Robinson & Oshlack, Genome Biology, 2010 ).\n",
    "3. For each gene, expression values were additionally normalized across samples using an inverse normal transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, GTEx implemented normalization on the count data using TMM (Pipeline B outlined above) although the TPM QC results were used to select samples and genes. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of possible improvement over the existing pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Should we try [GeTMM](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-018-2246-7) instead? According to their paper, GeTMM improves intra-sample analysis and is very easy to implement (add one line to TMM code, as shown in [this post](https://www.reneshbedre.com/blog/expression_units.html)). However inter-sample analysis such as DEG performs the same as TMM so perhaps not necessary for eQTL studies.\n",
    "2. Should we control for batch effect if we know the batches explicitly, so we don't rely on hidden factor analysis? What we can do are:\n",
    "    1. Read counts -> Combat-Seq -> inverse normal transformation\n",
    "    2. Do what we already have -> Add a batch adjustment using Combat on normalized data"

    "## Input\n",
    "\n",
    "1. TPM matrix and read count matrix in RNA-SeQC format\n",
    "    - the first two rows should be commented text with `#` prefix.\n",
    "    - the matrix should be tab delimited.\n",
    "    - the matrix files should end with `gct` suffix\n",
    "    - These requirements are satisfied if the inputs are outputs from [`bulk_expression_QC` pipeline](bulk_expression_QC.html).\n",
    "2. GTF for collapsed gene model\n",
    "    - the gene names must be consistent with the GCT matrices (eg ENSG00000000003 vs. ENSG00000000003.1 will not work) \n",
    "    - chromosome names must have `chr` prefix (although we can make it an option in the pipeline, currently we assume the `chr` prefix convention)\n",
    "3. Meta-data to match between sample names in expression data and genotype files\n",
    "    - Required input\n",
    "    - Tab delimited with header\n",
    "    - Only 2 columns: first column is sample name in expression data, 2nd column is sample name in genotype data\n",
    "    - **must contains all the sample name in expression matrices even if they don't existing in genotype data**"
