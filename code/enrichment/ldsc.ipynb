    "The purpose of this pipeline is to use LD Score Regression (LDSC) to analyze the heritability and enrichment of genome annotations across GWAS traits. By integrating genome annotation files and GWAS summary statistics, this pipeline allows single tau analysis (individual annotation contributions) and joint tau analysis (independent contributions of multiple annotations after removing shared effects).\n",
    "\n",
    "The pipeline is developed to integrate GWAS summary statistics data, annotation data, and LD reference panel data to compute functional enrichment for each of the epigenomic annotations that the user provides using the S-LDSC model. We will first start off with an introduction, instructions to set up, and the minimal working examples. Then the workflow code that can be run using SoS on any data will be at the end. \n",

    "## A brief review on Stratified LD score regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Here I briefly review LD Score Regression and what it is used for. For more in depth information on LD Score Regression please read the following three papers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"LD Score regression distinguishes confounding from polygenicity in genome-wide association studies\" by Sullivan et al (2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"Partitioning heritability by functional annotation using genome-wide association summary statistics\" by Finucane et al (2015)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"Linkage disequilibrium–dependent architecture of human complex traits shows action of negative selection\" by Gazal et al (2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated in Sullivan et al 2015, confounding factors and polygenic effects can cause inflated test statistics and other methods cannot distinguish between inflation from confounding bias and a true signal. LD Score Regression (LDSC) is a technique that aims to identify the impact of confounding factors and polygenic effects using information from GWAS summary statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach involves using regression to mesaure the relationship between Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) scores and test statistics of SNPs from the GWAS summary statistics. Variants in LD with a \"causal\" variant show an elevation in test statistics in association analysis proportional to their LD (measured by $r^2$) with the causal variant within a certain window size (could be 1 cM, 1kB, etc.). In contrast, inflation from confounders such as population stratification that occur purely from genetic drift will not correlate with LD. For a polygenic trait, SNPs with a high LD score will have more significant χ2 statistics on average than SNPs with a low LD score. Thus, if we regress the $\\chi^2$ statistics from GWAS against LD Score, the intercept minus one is an estimator of the mean contribution of confounding bias to the inflation in the test statistics. The regression model is known as LD Score regression. "

    "\n",
    "Under a polygenic assumption, in which effect sizes for variants are drawn independently from distributions with variance proportional to  $1/(p(1-p))$ where p is the minor allele frequency (MAF), the expected $\\chi^2$ statistic of variant j is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[\\chi^2|l_j] = Nh^2l_j/M + Na + 1 \\quad (1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is the sample size; $M$ is the number of SNPs, such that $h^2/M$ is the average heritability explained per SNP; $a$ measures the contribution of confounding biases, such as cryptic relatedness and population stratification; and $l_j = \\sum_k r^2_{jk}$ is the LD Score of variant $j$, which measures the amount of genetic variation tagged by $j$. A full derivation of this equation is provided in the Supplementary Note of Sullivan et al (2015). An alternative derivation is provided in Supplementary Note of Zhu and Stephens (2017) AoAS.\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we can see that LD Score regression can be used to compute SNP-based heritability for a phenotype or trait, from GWAS summary statistics and does not require genotype information like other methods such as REML do. "

    "### Stratified LDSC\n",
    "\n",
    "Heritability is the proportion of phenotypic variation (VP) that is due to variation in genetic values (VG) and thus can tell us how much of the difference in observed phenotypes in a sample is due to difference in genetics in the sample. It can also be extended to analyze partitioned heritability for a phenotype/trait split over categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Partitioned Heritability or Stratified LD Score Regression (S-LDSC) more power is added to our analysis by leveraging LD Score information as well as using SNPs that haven't reached Genome Wide Significance to partition heritability for a trait over categories which many other methods do not do. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "S-LDSC relies on the fact that the $\\chi^2$ association statistic for a given SNP includes the effects of all SNPs tagged by this SNP meaning that in a region of high LD in the genome the given SNP from the GWAS represents the effects of a group of SNPs in that region.\n",
    "\n",
    "S-LDSC determines that a category of SNPs is enriched for heritability if SNPs with high LD to that category have more significant $\\chi^2$ statistics than SNPs with low LD to that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, enrichment of a category is defined as the proportion of SNP heritability in the category divided by the proportion of SNPs in that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "More precisely, under a polygenic model, the expected $\\chi^2$ statistic of SNP $j$ is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[\\chi^2_j] = N\\sum_CT_Cl(j,C) + Na + 1 \\quad (2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N$ is sample size, C indexes categories, $ℓ(j, C)$ is the LD score of SNP j with respect to category $l(j,C) = \\sum_{k\\epsilon C} r^2_{jk}$, $a$ is a term that measures the contribution of confounding biases, and if the categories are disjoint, $\\tau_C$ is the per-SNP heritability in category $C$; if the categories overlap, then the per-SNP heritability of SNP j is $\\sum_{C:j\\epsilon C} \\tau_C$.  Equation 2 allows us to estimate $\\tau_C$ via a (computationally simple) multiple regression of $\\chi^2$ against $ℓ(j, C)$, for either a quantitative or case-control study. \n",
