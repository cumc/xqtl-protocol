    "3. Our column conventions are based on studies such as GTEx and eQTL category. Our design is \"modular\" in the sense that we do not provide information that could be trivially annotated after, such as **rsID, gene symbol, gene biotype, gene start and end positions**; or for information that can be inferred from other columns such as type of allele (SNP or INDEL).\n",
    "4. We use GRCh38 reference allele and alternative allele, and the effect allele is adjusted, as necessary, to the alternative allele.\n",
    "5. Summary statistics will be in conventional TSV format which can be converted to [GWAS-VCF format](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-020-02248-0) as needed.\n",

    "## Some technical notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If there are duplicated INDELs in the summary statistics, they will be removed. For example, two SNPs at 10000 on chr1. one's `A0` is `T`, and `A1` is `TC`. Whereas the other one's `A0` is `TC`, and `A1` is `T`. Both of them will be removed. More about INDEL issues(https://github.com/statgenetics/UKBB_GWAS_dev/issues/81#issuecomment-1015556800). For SNPs, `A0` and `A1` can be easily standardized to ref/alt in GRCh38 reference genome.\n",
    "2. If duplicated `chr:pos` (GWAS) or `gene:chr:pos` (TWAS) exist, run a recursive match for each pair of them between two summary statistic files (`query`(each of inputs) and `subject` (target file)). \n",
    "3. under the same `chr:pos` or `gene:chr:pos`, The variants' `A0` and `A1` are matched by exact, flip, reverse, or flip+reverse models. Only one of them is `True`, the variant in two files are matched. If they are matched by flip or flip+reverse, the sign of `query`'s `STAT` will be inversed. And the `query`'s `A0` and `A1` will be the same as the `subject`'s `A0` and `A1`.  **FIXME: should we standardize it to GRCh38 first?**     "
