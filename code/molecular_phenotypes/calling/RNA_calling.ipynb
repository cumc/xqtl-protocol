    "Our pipeline follows the GTEx pipeline from the [GTEx](https://gtexportal.org/home/aboutGTEx#staticTextAnalysisMethods)/[TOPMed](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/TOPMed_RNAseq_pipeline.md) project for the quantification of expression from RNA-seq data. Either paired end or single end fastq.gz files may be used as the initial input. Different read [strandedness options](https://rnabio.org/module-09-appendix/0009/12/01/StrandSettings/) are possible, including rf, fr, unstranded or strand_missing, based on library types from Signal et al [[cf. Signal et al (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-022-04572-7)]. Strand detection steps are included in this pipeline to automaticaly detect the strand of the input fastq file by levradging the gene count table ouptut from [STAR](https://physiology.med.cornell.edu/faculty/skrabanek/lab/angsd/lecture_notes/STARmanual.pdf). Read length data is required and is set to a default value of 100 for reads of zero length. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend using fastqc to quality control reads, followed by the removal of adaptors with fastp if necessary. After quality control has been conducted, STAR may be used to align reads to the reference genome. We combine this mapping step with an additionaly quality control step using Picard to mark duplicate reads and collect other metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Gene-level RNA expression is called with RNA-SeQC v2.4.2 using a reference gtf that has been collapsed to contain genes instead of gene transcripts [[cf. DeLuca et al., Bioinformatics, 2012](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bts196)]. Reads are only included if they are uniquely mapped (mapping quality of 255 for STAR BAMs), if they are aligned in proper pairs, if the read alignment distance was less than or equal to six (i.e. alignments must not contain more than six non-reference bases), and if they are fully contained within exon boundaries. Reads overlapping introns are not included. Exon level read counts are also called by RNA-SeQC. If a read overlaps multiple exons, then a fractional value equal to the portion of the read contained within the exon is allotted. We call transcript-level RNA expression using RSEM v1.3.0 with a transcript reference gtf. "

    "## Step 2: Remove adaptor through `fastp`\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)\n",
    "\n",
    "We use `fastp` in place of the `Trimmomatic` for fastp's ability to detect adapter from the reads. It was a c++ command line tool published in [Sept 2018](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/17/i884/5093234). It  will use the following algorithm to detect the adaptors:\n",
    ">The adapter-sequence detection algorithm is based on two assumptions: the first is that only one adapter exists in the data; the second is that adapter sequences exist only in the read tails. These two assumptions are valid for major next-generation sequencers like Illumina HiSeq series, NextSeq series and NovaSeq series. We compute the k-mer (k = 10) of first N reads (N = 1 M). From this k-mer, the sequences with high occurrence frequencies (>0.0001) are considered as adapter seeds. Low-complexity sequences are removed because they are usually caused by sequencing artifacts. The adapter seeds are sorted by its occurrence frequencies. A tree-based algorithm is applied to extend the adapter seeds to find the real complete adapter\n",
    "\n",
    "It was demostrated that fastp can remove all the adaptor automatically and completely faster than Trimmomatic and cutadapt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Inputs\n",
    "\n",
    "* `fastq`: 1 set of fq.gz file for each sample. (2 files if paired end, 1 file if single end )\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step Outputs\n",
    "* 1 set of  `fastq.gz` file for alignment. (2 files if paired end, 1 file if single end )\n",
    "* The unpaired reads (i.e.where a read survived, but the partner read did not.) will be discarded by default as those were not used in the following steps. This feature can be added were it was needed. \n",
    "* 1 set of html documenting the quality of input reads(1 html file and 1 json file)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step options\n",
    "\n",
    "A few options were selected to be customizable so that fastp step can have the same level of flexiblity as the Trimmomatic step had. They are:\n",
    "- min_len: length_required, reads shorter than this will be discarded, default is 15. (int [=15])\n",
    "- window_size: cut_window_size, the window size option shared by cut_front, cut_tail or cut_sliding. Range: 1~1000, default: 4 (int [=4])\n",
    "- leading/trailing : cut_front_mean_quality/cut_tail_mean_quality, the mean quality requirement option for cut_front/cut_tail, which move a sliding window from front/tail, drop the bases in the window if its mean quality < threshold. **Notice the choice of quality score in `fastp` (N=20) is a lot higher than that of `trimmomatic` (N=3)**. Default `fastp` setting is in line with that of [`cutadapt`](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html).\n",

MultiQC doesn't run other tools for you - it's designed to be placed at the end of analysis pipelines or to be run manually when you've finished running your tools. When you launch MultiQC, it recursively searches through any provided file paths and finds files that it recognises. It parses relevant information from these and generates a single stand-alone HTML report file. It also saves a directory of data files with all parsed data for further downstream use.\n",

    "## Step 8: Filter Reads with WASP\n",
    "\n",
    "This optional step in the STAR alignment process offers filtration based on WASP correction and unique read identification. WASP correction mitigates reference allele bias in RNA-seq data by eliminating reads with specific WASP flags. Unique read filtering retains only uniquely mapped reads, identified by a mapping quality (MAPQ) value of 255, as per GTEx Consortium standards. These filters can be applied individually or in combination to enhance alignment quality and prepare BAM files for different analysis.\n",
